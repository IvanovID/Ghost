# Quickstart Install

If you want to run your own instance of Ghost, in most cases the best way is to use our **CLI tool**

```
npm install ghost-cli -g
```

&nbsp;

Then, if installing locally add the `local` flag to get up and running in under a minute - [Local install docs](https://ghost.org/docs/install/local/)

```
ghost install local
```

&nbsp;

or on a server run the full install, including automatic SSL setup using LetsEncrypt - [Production install docs](https://ghost.org/docs/install/ubuntu/)

```
ghost install
```

&nbsp;
